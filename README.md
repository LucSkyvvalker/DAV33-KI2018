# DAV33-KI2018

A group project for the first year of Artificial Intelligence studies at the University of Amsterdam. 
This is an attempt to make use of Machine Learning alghoritms on a large Dataset on Global Food Prices.
All python scripts are example codes, the actual running of scripts was performed in Jupyter Notebook, but for compatibility reasons these were translated from .ipynb to .py for the Git Documentation.
  The dataset directory contains python scripts that were used to clean the dataset.
  The analytics directory contains python scripts that were used for analyzing the datasets.
The other directories are meant for the website used to show some of our findings, we have made use of Jekyll for the creation of this website. (special thanks goes to http://jmcglone.com/)
