	<h1> Global Food Prices</h1><br>
<p>There are numerous factors that influence global food prices. To prevent food crises it is important to analyze the food prices and research how they influence each other, so that preventive measures can be taken in advance.</p>
<p>Our goals for this project were to answer the following questions.</p><br>
<p3>Are there any food prices that are show negative/positive correlation, and is this correlation present throughout the years, or perhaps only in certain period? Can you perhaps detect possible ingredients of a certain other food product?</p3><br>
<p3>Do countries in similar regions, also show similar price differences? And if differences occur, can you find a potential explanation?</p3><br>
<p3>Can we see any correlations between other types of data, like: currency fluctuations, weather patterns, and/or refugee movements. Can we perhaps visualize refugee movements from the food price data? Do certain weather conditions influence market prices?</p3><br>
